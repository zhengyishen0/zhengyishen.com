## **Book Notes**

> My notes are in the form of [clipping](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipping_(publications)>) that summarizes a book in the author's own words. I have organized the excerpts from the book in a way that I find most digestible. Hope you enjoy it!

## Design Your Lifestyle With Intention

> _"The 'uncertain' path of doing your own thing is the quickest fix out there, people just lack perspective."_

### Your Unique Experience Matters

"You think your life is boringâ€¦ or at least too boring to be able to profit off of being yourself. Which is funny, because there are hundreds of thousands of people that would love to hear why you do what you do, they wonâ€™t think itâ€™s boring."

"Your unique experience on this Earth while pursuing those interests is what people care about â€” not the interests themselves. People care about how those interests will help impact their life. Your interests are the 'how.'"

"Your job is to provide clarity to those that align with your values, vision, goals, beliefs, and other components of your identity (this is what forms your perspective on things)."

"You must become a 'thought leader'. That means you have to take yourself, your work, and your life seriously."

### Be Passionate For Life Itself

"Stop trying to find your passion. Instead, cultivate a passion for life itself. All of its highs and lows. It SHOULD be difficult to have passion for a specific 1-3 things in life because you want to be passionate about everything."

"Seek to understand and learn from everything in life. This makes life 10x more enjoyable when you start to see the depth in everything you come across."

"You may not make this connection yet â€” but all worthwhile paths in life lead to the same endpoint, which is life itself."

"By getting in touch with yourself and cultivating self-awareness, you have all of the marketing firepower you need."

"The people that you can help the most are ones that have similar interests and goals. You will be the one that exposes them to other related interests and goals."

### Work On A Project

"You need a project to apply your learning to â€” otherwise, you wonâ€™t pick up on random information that has the potential to apply to the project you are working on. A project can be as simple as a tweet or newsletter in this case."

"Documenting projects that you are working on. Everything is a project if you want it to be. Your mental, physical, spiritual, and financial development can all be spun into lessons for those that are 2-3 steps behind you."

"By following everyone that talks about this subject, purchasing top-rated books on the subject, and exposing yourself to information left and right â€” you become a member of that 'niche.' Meaning that you have market research at your fingertips for when that time comes."

"We donâ€™t really know what we want. I donâ€™t think we ever will, but we have to have a direction to work in to figure out if we actually wanted it."

### Develop Information Consumption Funnel

"If you want to be truly creative, you need a lot of information to pull from."

"If you want a lot of information to pull from, you need to consistently expose yourself to new information (you need to expand your awareness / consciousness by pursuing your curiosity)."

"You need a mental (or digital) database of validated ideas that you can treat as digital legos for piecing together compelling content."

## Entrepreneurship Is Modern Survival

> _"Stack your creativity with other skills to make it marketable."_

### Attention

> "Attention Is The New Currency"

"The first step towards any transaction of value is capturing attention."

### Confirmation

> "Most people are looking for confirmation."

"People are not confident in their day to day actions. We are constantly looking to confirm our beliefs, choices, and actions. Because of this, we look to others beliefs, choices, and actions to see if something is credible or not."

### Selling

> "Leaders donâ€™t dance around the point they are trying to get across."

"YOU are always selling, or at least you should be. Not only selling products â€” but selling ideas and better ways of doing things. Thatâ€™s what people want."

### Writing

> "Writing is how you 'connect the dots.'"

"Writing is more than just a tool to attract attention. As you will come to find, writing is the key to clear thinking, true learning, and deep understanding."

"You were put on this earth to piece together the puzzle of reality â€“ your writing is how you document your findings."

### "Stealing"

> "We all just steal from each other to give different perspectives on a specific idea.

"If you want, you can take your favorite concepts or frameworks, note down the goal they help people achieve, come up with your own steps for achieving that goal, and create a framework that you can make your own and have your readers attribute to you."
